- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

- Cursor will do its best to reuse existing types from external packages (node_modules) or internal ones (generated by Prisma, or our codebase). Cursor will always make sure if we definitely cannot reuse existing types and interfaces, before proceeding to create new ones.
