- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer types over interfaces
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components, prefering `export const Component = () => {}`, without explicitly specifying the type of the component variable. Prefer declaring a separate type for the props if they're needed.

- Cursor will do its best to reuse existing types from external packages (node_modules) or internal ones (generated by Prisma, or our codebase). Cursor will always make sure if we definitely cannot reuse existing types and interfaces, before proceeding to create new ones.
