- All reusable components should go in src/components and be named in PascalCase like NewComponent.tsx
- Feature-specific components should go next to their respective app router's page file
- Use same rules for directories containing components - PascalCase name (e.g., components/NewComponent or components/AuthWizard).

- Favor named exports for components.
