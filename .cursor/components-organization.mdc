Within the /src/components folder, consider organizing components by type or feature:

By Type: Group components like forms, buttons, layout elements, etc.

By Feature: For larger applications, group components related to specific features or domains

For example:

/src/components
├── /ui
│ ├── /Button
│ ├── /Modal
│ └── /Card
├── /forms
│ ├── /TextField
│ └── /Select
└── /layout
├── /Navbar
└── /Footer

- Private Components: For components used only within specific pages, you can create a \_components folder within the relevant /app subdirectory.

- Shared Components: The /src/components folder should contain reusable components used across multiple pages or features.

- Modular Approach: As the project grows, consider adopting a more modular structure, where each feature or domain has its own folder containing components, hooks, and utilities specific to that feature.
